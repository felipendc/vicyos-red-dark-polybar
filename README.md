1) Install the fonts using the "install-fonts.sh" file inside fonts folder

2) If you face any problem with Polybar not working on your Desktop or Laptop, you just need to
make following files "executable".

/home/user/.config/polybar/launch.sh

and all the files inside:
/home/user/.config/polybar/scripts/
